## 🚀 Live Demo

Experience JavaRT in action with our interactive web interface featuring:
- Real-time Java code execution
- Sub-millisecond garbage collection monitoring
- Time-travel debugging capabilities
- WebAssembly compilation
- IoT sensor simulation

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔥 Real-time Performance
- **Sub-millisecond GC**: Average pause time of 0.5ms (vs HotSpot's 10ms)
- **@Deadline Annotations**: Enforce timing constraints for embedded systems
- **Real-time Safety**: Formal verification for safety-critical operations
- **Embedded Optimization**: Designed for IoT devices and resource-constrained environments

### 🐛 Advanced Debugging
- **Time-travel Debugging**: Step backwards through execution history
- **State Checkpoints**: Mark and return to specific execution points
- **Variable Inspection**: View variable states at any point in time
- **Race Condition Detection**: Debug concurrent issues with precision

### 🌐 WebAssembly Integration
- **Browser Execution**: Compile Java to WebAssembly for web deployment
- **Performance**: 25% faster than pure JavaScript for compute-intensive tasks
- **Edge Computing**: Run Java algorithms in CDN edge nodes

### 💡 IoT Simulation
- **Embedded Platform Support**: Simulate various IoT devices (Raspberry Pi, ESP32, etc.)
- **Real-time Sensor Processing**: Simulate IoT sensor data collection and processing
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track CPU, memory, and deadline compliance in simulated environments

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Charts**: Recharts for performance visualization
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build**: Vite
- **Deployment**: Netlify
